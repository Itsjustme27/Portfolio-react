                                    A passionate developer, IT enthusiast, and aspiring cybersecurity enthusiast. I thrive on solving problems, building creative solutions, and exploring the intersection of technology and security.

                                    With hands-on experience in tools like ReactJS, TypeScript, Linux, and Python, I specialize in building secure, efficient applications. </p>

                                <p>My journey in tech began during my studies in IT, and I've been continuously learning ever sinceâ€”participating in events like TryHackMe's Advent of Cyber and solving CTF challenges to hone my skills.

                                    I aim to bridge the gap between development and cybersecurity by creating systems that are both functional and secure. When I'm not coding or studying, I enjoy music, puzzles, and sharing knowledge with my peers.
